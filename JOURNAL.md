DISCLAIMER: I had been working on this project even before Highway

| Date started: March 17, 2025 

Total hours spent: 
On a school day: 1 hour avg
During the summer (start May 1, 2025): 3 hours avg every 2 days

However, I didn't really document every single day (April was busy month, so we're getting rid of half of those days)

For May, there were on and off days but I was averaging around 3 hours every 2 days, same with June.

However, in June as highway drew nearer, I averaged 5 hours every 2 days. Start: June 13

Estimating: 
1 * 29 (March - April)
+
3 * 18(May - June days)
+
5 * x (June 13 Onwards)
